# Welcome to Moja UI

A Component Library built on state machines for a range of JavaScript frameworks and Tailwind CSS with full customization styling options

## Motivation

Most popular Component libraries come headless (without styling) and tailored for particular JavaScript frameworks. While this approach provides agility for development teams, it requires alot more development time in defining the styling and also not a very convenient solution for developers with a shallow eye for design.

Additionally, most component libraries tightly couple design and functionality, making customization difficult and sometimes impossible.

## Solution

The goal of Moja UI is to provide a comprehensive selection of fully accessible, interactive and fully customisable UI components with full typescript support.

Unlike many component libraries, Moja UI ships each component as individual packages which can be used as standalone components. There is also an alternative to install the entire component library.
This will be covered in later sections.
