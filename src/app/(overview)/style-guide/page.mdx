Learn how to Style Moja UI components.

## Overview

Moja UI offers a collection of ready-to-use, pre-styled components designed for ease of integration. However, depending on your projectâ€™s specific needs, you may want to customize their appearance to better align with your brand identity. This guide will explore various methods to tailor Moja UI components.

## Data Attributes

Moja UI components include `data-*` attributes to indicate their internal state. For example, this is what an open modal looks like:

```js
<div role="dialog" data-state="open"></div>
```

You can refer to the documentation for each component to find detailed information about their data attributes.
